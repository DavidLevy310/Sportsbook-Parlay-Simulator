# Sportsbook-Parlay-Simulator

## Python script which simulates hypothetical parlay bets and generates a pnl/probability distribution

# Background

*This script was written to solve a practice problem I was presented with.

*Assume that a sportsbook is taking Parlay bets from customers and a Parlay submission consists of 2 or more choices.

*There are 5 questions the customer can answer either Yes or No to, or choose not to answer.

# The Hypothetical Probability of each question/answer occurring is below:

# 1Yes = 50% 1No = 50%

# 2Yes = 20% 2No = 80%

# 3Yes = 30% 3No = 70%

# 4Yes = 10% 4No = 90%

# 5Yes = 50% 5No = 50%

Challenge: Build a probability distribution for the sportsbook, with PNL on the x-axis and Probability on the y-axis

1) This script creates a list of all possible parlay submissions and the associated probability of occurring.
2) It then allows you to randomly choose x amount of submissions from the list
3) Based on the submissions chosen and the bet size per parlay, the script will generate a probability distribution for the sportsbook
4) The x-axis is PNL and the y-axis is probability of occurrence

# Note that if a parlay hits for a customer, they are paid out PROFIT as follows:

(1/(Probability parlay wins))*(bet size) - bet size
